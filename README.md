# Zebrariders
Given an 𝑛 × 𝑛 chessboard, the dominating zebrariders problem is to put as fewest zebrariders to the board as possible so that all squares in the board are either occupied or attacked (that is, reached) by a zebrarider. In this assignment, you will write a program to put zebrariders to the board one by one until all the zebrariders “dominate” the board. Figure 2 shows an example 8 × 8 board configuration. In the figure, ‘Z’ denotes a zebrarider, ‘=’ denotes a square that is attacked (reached) by a zebrarider, and ‘.’ denotes an unattacked (free) square.
